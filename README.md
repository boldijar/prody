From the moment the mobile development platforms just started, to this point, a lot of time has passed. 
Rewriting every single line of code is very annoying, and this is done every time a new similar project is needed. The solution is to use the same codebase, and maybe extend it, if some new feature is just to custom in order to keep it generic, and branch out of this project.


This app can grow when new features are needed, and while keeping them very generic, to be compatible to as much ideas as possible, but still being not very hard to customize it from the configs, and using some simple databases.
Is redundant to write the same kind of application over and over again, with similar features, and this project will help developers achieve what they really need, developing the desired application, as fast as possible, while keeping the builds clean and stable, with as little code as we can.


Contact pages are available for most of the apps on the playstore, and they are not that hard to customize, because a page can probably show one of the next things:

* Email addresses;
* Phone numbers;
* Extra text;
* Street address;
* Working schedule.


And because weâ€™re targeting mobile platforms, all of this parts of the contact page, must be accessed quickly, through deep linking, or custom intents that will open the desired activities, so the user is one tap away to contact the business or public person he wants, without any extra work.


This application has a very generic implementation of this problem, and can handle most of the cases like this.
